# information-system-for-the-JavaEat-restaurant

this project aims on developing an information system for a restaurant, which operates on a delivery-based business model. The system is designed to help the restaurant employees manage deliveries efficiently, calculate economic profits, and improve the overall profitability of the business. The project consists of a graphical user interface for the customer and the ability to save and load system data.

Key objectives and features of the project include:
1. User Interface: Developed screens that support the following functionality:
  1.1. Creating objects in the system using various add methods and displaying informative success and failure messages.
  1.2. Deleting objects in the system using various remove methods and displaying informative success and failure messages.
  1.3. Executing all queries in the system and displaying the results through user-friendly screens.
  
 2. Data Persistence: Implemented functionality for saving and restoring system data in the "ser.Rest" file using the Serializable interface. This file serves as a type of database and helps maintain the state of the Restaurant object across sessions.

3. Exception Handling: Ensured proper exception handling by displaying error messages (pop-up) to the user and providing appropriate error messages.

4. Custom Exception Classes: Created custom exception handling classes for identifying and displaying errors, which are placed in the "Exceptions" package.

5. Component Selection: Chose the most appropriate components for each item on the screens, such as text fields, selection lists, etc.


This project demonstrates the development of an efficient and user-friendly information system for a restaurant, designed to optimize and streamline work processes, improve profitability, and enhance the overall customer experience.
